create table student
 (
 sid int(10),
 sname char(20),
 marks int(10),
 gender varchar(10),
 branch varchar(20)
  );

desc student;

 insert into student values(100,'SHREE',99,'Male','IT');

 select * from student;

 create view IT_STUDENT as
select * from student where branch='IT';
show tables;

 select * from IT_student;

 select * from student;

create view CSE_STUDENT as
 select * from student where branch='CSE';
select * from CSE_STUDENT;
 create view ENTC_STUDENT as
 select * from student where branch='ENTC';
select * from ENTC_STUDENT;
